While reading this paper I realized how big an impact it had on computer vision. The authors showed that deep neural networks can learn to recognize objects by themselves just by seeing many examples. Before this work most people believed that a vision system needed to be built step by step by human experts. The paper proved that with enough data and computing power machines can learn patterns automatically. One main challenge that stood out to me was the high need for resources. The network had sixty million parameters and took almost a week to train on two GPUs. Collecting and labeling such a large dataset was also very difficult. This means that the approach, while powerful, was not easy for everyone to use. I think a future improvement could be to make training faster and less dependent on large labeled datasets. Using self-learning or transfer learning could help models perform well even with limited data. Overall I felt the paper was very inspiring because it showed how data and computation can work together to make machines learn like humans.
