The paper talks about how deep neural networks can be used to recognize objects in images more accurately than older hand-designed methods. Earlier, people believed that image recognition systems had to be carefully made by experts, but this paper showed that a network can learn directly from data. The researchers used a very large dataset called ImageNet, which had over a million labeled images from one thousand categories. They built a deep convolutional neural network with eight layers, used Rectified Linear Units to make learning faster, and trained it on two GPUs to handle the heavy computation. To avoid overfitting, they used data augmentation and dropout while training. The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent for several days. Their results were far better than all earlier approaches, cutting the top-5 error rate from around twenty-six percent to just fifteen percent. This paper proved that deep learning could automatically learn features and achieve record-breaking accuracy in visual recognition.
